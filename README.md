# GungHoGame

This is a game made for GungHo
A little game called PunchBall

The gameplay is very simple - punch the balls out of the arena before they explode.

The custom Outline shader is able to be edited by the material
The fields include a main color, tint color, tint strength, outline color, and outline size.

Unfortunately, I really wanted the player to be able to punch while running and in the air
for this game, which hurts the animation smoothing.
I also shortened the punch animation a bit because the woundup was too long.
